- `03_exercise_titanic_att1.ipynb`: The titanic dataset exercise. This is my first attempt tackling the titanic dataset. Contains some feature selection, feature engineering, data analysis and visualization.

- `03_exercise_titanic_att2.ipynb`: Contains my second attempt on the Titanic dataset challenge. I tried using more features that were not used in the first dataset, like `name` and `cabin`, and also tried better categorization, like for example in the age interval, trying to be less arbitrary.

### Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow - Examples, exercises and projects.

#### Book by Aurélien Géron
#### Solutions by Silvio Jonas da Silva
#### All solutions with Python programming language.

## Introduction

This repository contains codes for examples, projects and hands-on projects from the book ["Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

This repository is a result of my efforts in learning Data Science and Machine Learning and I will provide here attempts on solving the suggested exercises as better as possible during my journey. Some notebooks are just as the one provided by the author, but the code for resolution to the suggested exercises as well as possible improvements suggested by the author in the solution code gave by him are all original and are results of my attempts.

## What you will find in each folder:

### [chapter_1](https://github.com/silvio-sjsj/hands-on_ML_exercises/tree/main/chapter_1)
Chapter 1 is **The Machine Learning landscape**
This folder contains just a code example as given in the book. 

### [chapter_2](https://github.com/silvio-sjsj/hands-on_ML_exercises/tree/main/chapter_2) 
Chapter 2 is **End-to-end Machine Learning project**. This chapter deals with a regression problem from the [California Housing dataset](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/python_scripts/datasets_california_housing.html) a very well-known dataset used specially by beginners in ML competitions and learning. The goal of the chapter is to introduce regression problems and how to work on a dataset so it can be ready for a regression algorithm. During this task the author introduces the idea of cleanning the data, scaling, adding and testing features etc so in the end it can code a pipeline and let the data ready for the ML algorithm. It trains several models to compare results and introduce the ideas of fine-tuning using GridSearch and RandomizedSearch. One of the best and most complete resource for learning that can be found nowadays.

### [chapter_3](https://github.com/silvio-sjsj/hands-on_ML_exercises/tree/main/chapter_3)
Chapter 3 is **Classification**. This chapter deals with classification algorithms using the famous [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) that are also very suitable for beginners and students. This dataset is widely used for testing algorithms and studying new concepts in the field. 

### [chapter_4](https://github.com/silvio-sjsj/hands-on_ML_exercises/tree/main/chapter_4)
Chapter 4 is **Training models**. This chapter deals with the concepts of training a model. In the first chapters the Learning algorithms were treated as 'black boxes': they work! but how do they learn? what means minimizing a cost function? this chapter deals with those questions and introduces cost functions and algorithms to minimize them like, for example, Gradient Descent.

### [chapter_5](https://github.com/silvio-sjsj/hands-on_ML_exercises/tree/main/chapter_5)
Chapter 5 is **Support Vector Machines**. This chapter introduces and discuss Support Vector Machines for regression and classification tasks.
